A go package to execute shell commands in specified order. Currently supports executing list of shell commands in following orders:
* Series
* Parallel

## Installation
You can download the package using
```sh
go get github.com/amalfra/oexec/v3
```
## Usage
Next, import the package
``` go
import (
  "github.com/amalfra/oexec/v3"
)
```
You can execute list of shell commands in following orders:
* Series
* Parallel

The result of each command will be returned as ```oexec.Output``` struct which has fields
* Stdout - a ```byte``` array containing stdout produced by the command. Will be nil if command status is non zero
* Stderr - an ```error``` object containing stderr returned by the command. Will be nil if command status is zero  

### executing in series
To execute commands in series call the function as
``` go
oexec.Series("ls -l", "pwd")
```
You can pass any number of commands to execute as parameters. All the passed commands will get executed in series and results will be return once all of them are completed. The results are returned as an array of ```oexec.Output``` struct, having the result corresponding to a command at same position of argument as in Series function call(position starts are zero)

### executing in parallel
> Note: Precisely the commands will be executed concurrently unless configured otherwise via ```GOMAXPROCS``` environment variable and depending on underlying hardware

To execute commands in parallel call the function as
``` go
oexec.Parallel("ls -l", "pwd")
```
You can pass any number of commands to execute as parameters. All the passed commands will get executed in parallel and results will be return once all of them are completed. The results are returned as an array of ```oexec.Output``` struct, having the result corresponding to a command at same position of argument as in Series function call(position starts are zero)
